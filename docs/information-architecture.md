## 1. Product frame

ProBooking is a two-sided marketplace for **temporary clinic shifts** in Thailand.

> **Verified. Available. Bookable. Payment Protected.**

| Side | Job to be done |
|---|---|
| **Clinic** | Find, invite, offer, pay, and complete a temporary professional shift |
| **Professional** | Find verified work, accept clear terms, attend, and get paid |
| **Operations** | Verify parties, resolve holds/cases, keep the marketplace trustworthy |
| **Finance** | Reconcile money, run dual-control refunds, export truth |
| **System (worker)** | Time-driven completion, expiry, reminders, review publish |

A normal booking is self-service. Humans handle verification and exceptions behind the scenes (PRD §1.2).

---

## 2. Site map (web surfaces)

Routes live under `apps/web/src/app/`. GitHub Pages may prefix `/probooking` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`).

```
/
├── /                    Landing — brand, role picker, how-it-works
├── /signin              Demo sign-in / role switch / reset demo
├── /clinic              Clinic owner workspace
├── /pro                 Professional workspace
├── /ops                 Operations console
├── /finance             Finance reconciliation & refunds
└── /flow                Eng smoke harness (full vertical slice)
```

### 2.1 Surface inventory

| Route | Audience | Entry | In-page sections |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | Everyone | Direct / brand | Hero → Role picker → How it works → Footer (link to `/flow`) |
| `/signin` | Demo users | Header “Sign in” | Role picker + reset demo |
| `/clinic` | Clinic owner | Role picker | Post shift → My shifts (candidates / offer / confirm) → Bookings (complete / cancel) |
| `/pro` | Professional | Role picker | Offers → Open shifts (apply) → My jobs (arrive / complete / review) |
| `/ops` | Operations | Role picker or header | Metrics → Pending verification → Open cases → Active bookings (hold / suspend) |
| `/finance` | Finance | Role picker or header | Summary → Reconciliation → Propose/approve refunds → CSV export |
| `/flow` | Eng / e2e | Footer or header | Automated register→…→review harness |

There is **no nested route tree** and **no sidebar app shell**. Deep work happens as sections on role pages. Global chrome is `AppHeader` (Home · Ops · Finance · Flow · Sign in) plus theme toggle; `/clinic` and `/pro` are reached only via the role picker.

## 3. Actors, authority, and entry

### 3.1 Roles (PRD §3)

| Role | Primary surface | Binding / money authority |
|---|---|---|
| `clinic_owner` | `/clinic` | Post, offer, pay, cancel, confirm completion |
| `clinic_staff` | *(API only today)* | Draft / search / shortlist / message — no money |
| `professional` | `/pro` | Profile, availability, apply, accept, complete, review |
| `operations` | `/ops` | Verify, cases, holds, suspensions |
| `finance` | `/finance` | Payout/refund/reconcile; dual-control on high-value |
| `administrator` | API / staff phones | Access, high-risk, config, exceptional approval |
| `worker` | Background jobs | Auto-accept, flag inactive — no human UI |

### 3.2 Auth states

1. **Anonymous** — `/`, `/signin`, `/flow`
2. **Party session** — clinic or professional JWT (OTP) → `/clinic` or `/pro`
3. **Staff session** — ops/finance/admin via `STAFF_PHONES` → `/ops` or `/finance`
4. **Unverified party** — may register/browse; cannot post or transact until Ops verifies

**Auth mechanism:** Thai mobile OTP (`POST /auth/otp/request`, `/verify`). Token proves phone possession; **authority is derived from the identity graph** (membership / professional profile / staff phones), never from a role claimed in the request body. Browser session: `sessionStorage` key `probook.session`.

Demo accounts (`lib/demo-accounts.ts`) map one-click to each surface; `/signin` can reset seeded data (`POST /demo/reset`).

---

## 4. Domain objects (content model)

Owned records are the source of truth; customer labels are **derived**; holds and cases are **overlays** (PRD §6.2).

```
Identity
  User ──┬── Membership ── ClinicWorkspace (branch, verification)
         └── ProfessionalProfile ── Credential, InsuranceEvidence,
                                    PayoutAccount, Availability

Marketplace
  Shift ── Application | Invitation | Offer (≤1 active/shift) ── Booking (≤1/shift)

Booking overlays
  Message, AttendanceEvent, Review, heldAt (credential hold)

Ops
  SupportCase, RiskIncident, AuditRecord, ApprovalRequest

Finance (append-only)
  PaymentOrder → FinancialAllocation → FinancialEvent
  (Collection | Refund | Payout | Reversal | Adjustment | ProviderCost)

Notifications
  Notification (email/SMS send audit)
```

### 4.1 Primary state machines

| Object | States (abbrev.) |
|---|---|
| Shift | Draft → Published → Paused / Closed / Cancelled / Archived |
| Application | Submitted → Shortlisted → OfferSent → Booked \| Declined / Withdrawn / NotSelected / Expired |
| Invitation | Sent → Viewed → Interested \| Declined / Withdrawn / Expired |
| Offer | PendingResponse → AwaitingPayment → Converted \| Declined / Withdrawn / Expired / PaymentFailed |
| Booking | Confirmed → InProgress → AwaitingCompletion → ServiceCompleted \| Cancelled / Archived |
| PaymentOrder | Created → Pending → PaymentProtected \| Failed / Expired / Refunding / Refunded / Exception |
| Payout | NotEligible → Processing → Paid \| Failed / Held / Reversed |
| Verification | Draft → Submitted → UnderReview → NeedsInformation → Verified \| Rejected / Suspended / Expired / Closed |
| Case | Open → AwaitingUser / UnderReview → Resolved \| Reopened |

Money unit: **satang** (integer). Default clinic fee: **12%** (`SERVICE_FEE_BPS=1200`).

## 5. Flow catalog

Flows are grouped by journey. Each lists **entry**, **steps**, **primary APIs**, and **UI coverage** (`UI` = interactive page, `API` = endpoint exists, `Worker` = background, `Gap` = PRD/BDD without dedicated party UI).

---

### Flow A — Orientation & access

| A2 | Demo sign-in / role switch | `/` or `/signin` | Pick account → OTP → land on role route | UI |
| A3 | Reset demo dataset | `/signin` | Confirm → `POST /demo/reset` → clear session | UI |
| A4 | Logout / session revoke | Any signed-in surface | `POST /auth/logout`; admin may revoke/suspend | API (+ partial UI) |

## 6. Cross-cutting IA rules

1. **One active offer per shift; one booking per shift.**
2. **Verify before binding money** — unverified parties cannot post/transact.
3. **Payment Protected before “real” booking** — customer language must match PaymentOrder state.
4. **Holds and cases overlay** — they never rewrite base Booking state.
5. **Customer status is derived** — UI labels come from owning records (BDD area 14).
6. **Dual control on high-value money** — propose ≠ approve; different authorized people.
7. **Authority is derived from identity**, not request-body roles.
8. **No patient data** in normal messaging or records.
9. **Thai-first UI**; times Asia/Bangkok; money THB/satang.
10. **Phase 0 concierge** — Ops may match/verify manually, but must use controlled API actions (no spreadsheet-as-system-of-record).

---

## 7. UI coverage vs product IA (honesty map)

| Capability | Product IA (PRD) | Web UI today | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role entry / demo auth | Required | Strong | Role picker + OTP demo |
| Post shift / offer / pay / cancel | Core clinic | Strong on `/clinic` | |
| Apply / accept / arrive / complete / review | Core pro | Strong on `/pro` | |
| Ops verify / hold / suspend | Core ops | Strong on `/ops` | Audit list not in UI |
| Finance reconcile / dual refund / export | Core finance | Strong on `/finance` | |
| Self-serve register | Phase 0 | Thin | `/flow` + API; party pages use seeds |
| Availability CRUD | Phase 0/1 | Gap | API + BDD only |
| Invite + respond | Phase 0/1 | Gap | API + BDD only |
| Messaging / contact | Phase 0/1 | Gap | API + BDD only |
| Insurance upload (pro) | Phase 0/1 | Gap | Ops verify exists |
| Search professionals (clinic) | Phase 1 | Gap | `GET /professionals` API |
| Support case open from booking | Phase 0 | Partial | Ops sees cases; party open Gap |
| Full calendar / native / Instant Book | Non-goal | Out of scope | PRD §1.6 |

---

## 8. BDD ↔ flow index

| BDD area | Maps to flows |
|---|---|
| 01 Verification & restricted browsing | G1–G3, G10 |
| 02 Availability & conflicts | C2, D1 |
| 03 Search, applications, invitations | B3, C3–C4, invite path |
| 04 Clinic authority & one active offer | B4 |
| 05 Offer expiry, soft hold, payment, confirm | B5–B7, D1–D4 |
| 06 Callbacks & conservation | D4–D5 |
| 07 Urgent priority | D7 |
| 08 Messaging & patient data | H1–H3 |
| 09 Completion & auto-accept | E1–E5 |
| 10 Cancellation & support | F1–F6 |
| 11 Payout/refund dual-control | E6, I1–I6 |
| 12 Reviews & cold-start | J1–J4 |
| 13 Credential failure after confirmation | G6–G9 |
| 14 Derived status & audit | §6 rule 5, F6 |
| 15–20 Case suites | Confirmation, completion/payout, cancellation, offer lifecycle, authorization, onboarding |

---

## 9. Suggested reading order for new contributors

1. This document — surfaces and flows  
2. PRD §4 journeys + §3 roles  
3. `investor-demo-capabilities.md` — prove the paths by hand  
4. `architecture.md` — how API/domain/worker enforce the flows  
5. `features/README.md` — acceptance scenarios for each flow  

---

## 10. Change control

Update this IA when:

- A new App Router page or major in-page section ships  
- A PRD journey step moves from Gap → UI (or the reverse)  
- A new worker job or money/approval path is added  
- Navigation (header / role picker) changes  

Prefer linking to PRD requirement IDs and BDD areas over duplicating policy text.
